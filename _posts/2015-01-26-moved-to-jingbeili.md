`.li` is the ccTLD(Internet country code top-level domain) for Liechtenstein. I first saw this domain is at [iisp.com](http://www.iisp.com). The price is pretty high(about $40/year) and made me give up.

It so happened that this domain is also sold at [namecheap](http://www.namecheap.com) with 14.99$/year. According to the significance of this domain to me and such a low price, I bought it with no second thought.

BTW, I also set up a custom email with this domain, [i@jingbei.li](mailto:i@jingbei.li). But my old main email account seems to need a long time to fade out.

The next step is to build a site shortening urls using [YOURLS](http://yourls.org/). But I have to wait the DNS synchronization for a while.
